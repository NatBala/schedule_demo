## Quick sales angles (advisor FAQ-style)

* **“What makes them ‘active’ ETFs?”**
  All Capital Group ETFs are actively managed (no index replication), disclose **daily holdings**, and trade intraday; they can show a small premium/discount and tight median spreads (e.g., CGUS 0.02% 30-day median). ([CapitalGroup NACG][14])

* **“How do I position the equity ‘prudent growth’ wrappers (CGIE/CGGE)?”**
  They explicitly target **smoother full-cycle profiles** with an emphasis on quality and downside capture—good complements to pure-beta international/global exposures. ([CapitalGroup NACG][4])

* **“Who are the portfolio managers?”**
  Each details page lists current PMs and experience (years at CG and in the industry). Point advisors there for the up-to-date roster. ([CapitalGroup NACG][4])

* **“Where can I pull distributions and tax info?”**
  Each fund has **historical distributions** and **historical prices** pages; muni funds include AMT notes where relevant. ([CapitalGroup NACG][23])
