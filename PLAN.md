## Demo Flow

### 1. Opening (Personalized)
**Sarah**: "Hi Nat, this is Sarah with American Funds. I'm calling because we noticed you've been looking at ETF products on our webpage, and many advisors like yourself are looking for better ETF solutions. Do you have a few minutes to discuss what you're seeing with your clients right now?"

### 2. Permission Request
- Waits for advisor response
- If YES: Proceeds to discovery
- If NO/BUSY: Offers alternative timing

### 3. Discovery Questions (Ask One at a Time)
1. "What are your clients most concerned about in today's market environment?"
2. "Are you currently using ETFs in your client portfolios? Which ones are working well for you?"
3. "What gaps do you see in your current ETF lineupâ€”maybe income, growth, or international exposure?"
4. "How important is active management versus passive indexing for your client base?"
5. "Are your clients asking for more tax-efficient investment options?"
6. "What's driving the most interest from your clients this quarterâ€”income generation, growth, or capital preservation?"

### 4. Rapport Building
- References webpage interest: "That's exactly what I thought you might be interested in, Nat, based on what you were looking at on our site..."
- Shares performance data when relevant: "Our CGUS has been performing really well - 29.43% over the past year"
- Shows understanding and builds connection

### 5. Interest Assessment
"Based on what you're telling me, it sounds like [summarize their needs/challenges]. This is exactly what our wholesaler specializes in helping with. Is this something you'd be open to exploring further?"

### 6. Meeting Scheduling (Only if Interested)
"Great! How does **Tuesday 10:30am PT** or **Thursday 2:00pm PT** for a **15â€“20 min** intro sound? Virtual is easiest, but we can meet in person if you prefer."

### 7. Confirmation & Email Trigger
"Perfectâ€”so we're set for [day/date/time/timezone]. I'm sending you a follow-up email right now with all the details and a brief agenda. Do you have any questions, or is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Email not sending:**
- Check AWS SES credentials
- Verify sender/recipient emails are verified in AWS SES
- Check if in SES sandbox mode (limits sending)

**Voice not working:**
- Ensure microphone permissions granted
- Check OpenAI API key is valid
- Verify WebSocket connection in browser console

**Wrong greeting:**
- Clear browser cache and refresh
- Restart the application
- Check session_instructions are loading correctly

**Code changes not reflecting:**
- Kill all Python processes: `powershell "Get-Process python | Stop-Process -Force"`
- Restart application completely fresh
- This is CRITICAL when updating greetings, instructions, or core functionality

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test email delivery with timing
python simple_test.py

# Check AWS SES email verification status  
python verify_emails.py

# View application logs in real-time
python app.py  # Check console output

# Force restart when code changes aren't reflecting (IMPORTANT!)
powershell "Get-Process python | Stop-Process -Force"
python app.py
```
